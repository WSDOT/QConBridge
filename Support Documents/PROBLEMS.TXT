Know Problems With QConBridge Version 1.x

Installing over 16bit Beta-test versions
-----------------------------------------------
All Versions
If you had a 16Bit Beta-test version of QConBridge and you installed
the 32Bit production version into the
same directories, you may be encountering some strange problems.  To
resolve these problems, delete the
QConBridge directory and re-install it.

CTRL3D32.DLL is missing
---------------------------------
Version 1.0
Some of the very first version of QConBridge that were downloaded
didn't contain the file CTRL3D32.DLL in the
distribution package. The problems associated with this can be
resolved by downloading and installing the
latest version.

Section Properties Calculator - Kg is incorrect
--------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.0
The Section Properties Calculator computes the parameter Kg
incorrectly. Composite girder properties were used
instead of non-composite propertes. This problem has been corrected
in Version 1.0a

Section Properties Calculator - User defined girders aren't available
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---
Version 1.0a
In version 1.0a, I-beam and Bulb-Tee sections can be defined by the
user. Due to a bug in the installation
software, the location of the girder library file (GIRDER.TBL) is not
setup correctly if QConBridge was
install on any disk other than C. To correct the problem check the
QCONBRDG.INI file for the following
section 

[UserTables]
GirderTable=c:\qconbrdg\girder.tbl

Change the path to the location where GIRDER.TBL resides

Section Properties Calculator - gMoment 2+ Loaded Lanes
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.0a
The live load distribution factor for moment for 2 or more loaded
lanes for an interior girder is computed
incorrectly. The gross slab thickness is used for <I>ts</I> in the
distribution factor equation. The net slab
thickness should have been used (gross slab thickness - sacrafical
depth). This will be corrected shortly, and
a new version made available for download. In the mean time, using a
sacrifical depth of zero will result in
the correct distribution factor being calculated.
