General Notes for OWLtools
===============================================================================
The following compiler directives must be defined when building OWLtools:
_BUILDOWLDLL
_OWLDLL (this implies _RTLDLL and _BIDSDLL are defined as well)


The following compiler directive must be defined for any project using OWLtools:
_OWLDLL (this implies _RTLDLL and _BIDSDLL are defined as well)


The compiler directives may be defined by selecting
Options|Project|Compiler|Defines.


When this library is in it's final form, the lib file should be placed in
BC45\LIB or some other common library location. The dll should be placed in
the WINDOWS or WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory, or some other command directory that
is included in the path. The hpp files should be placed in BC45\INCLUDE or
some other command header file location.


Enhancement Notes for OWLtools
===============================================================================

BITMAP CONTROL:
The Bitmap Control and the Bitmap Window should be combined to derive from one
common ancestor. The are very closely related and should belong to the same
family.

TLinkedLBox and TLinkedLBoxButton:
It would be better if these controls could be encapculated into one reusable
control.

TRealDC:
I have found that it is by far faster to use native GDI commands that to
use the TRealDC commands. In my latest application (CBA.EXE) I have been
mapping the real numbers into integer numbers using TRealDC, but doing all
of the actual drawing and painting with TDC. This leads me to the suggestion
that TRealDC should be broken into two classes, TRealMapper and TRealDC

   TDC     TRealMapper
    ^           ^
    |           |
    +-----+-----+
          |
       TRealDC

This will allow future applications to get the mapping benifits of TRealDC,
without the overhead of the TRealDC drawing functions, in addition, the
multiple inheritance will preserve any TRealDC object currently in use.

UnitEdit controls:
When updating the window size for a new text label, the size should change before
the string is updated. This will eliminate the flicker problem.
